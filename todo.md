## Redesign Profile Page to Use Jquery and AMS to GET Photos
On each user profile page I want to render that User's photos using JQuery. The Profile Page should use AJAX and Jquery to  show all the users photos. 

  - [x] Build Serializers
  - [x] Update backend index action in profile/photos to render in JSON format. 
  - [x] Append the photos to the profile page (in your div?)



  ## The Photo Serializer
  - [x] WE want one endpoint to make one request and get back structured data representing each profile's photos / each photos comments. 


# Use AJAX / JQUERY and AMS JSON Backend to render photo show page and allow a user to sift through posts by clicking 'Next' with the photo being fetched and rendered via JQuery/Ajax
