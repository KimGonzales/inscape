## Redesign Profile Page to Use Jquery and AMS to GET Photos
On each user profile page I want to render that User's photos using JQuery. The Profile Page should use AJAX and Jquery to  show all the users photos. 

  - [ ] Build a Serializer
  - [ ] Update backend index action in profile/photos to render in JSON format. 
  - [ ] Append the photos to the profile page (in your div?)
  - [ ]


  ## The Photo Serializer
  - [ ] WE want one endpoint to make one request and get back structured data representing each profile's photos / each photos comments.
